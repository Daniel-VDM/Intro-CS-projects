# -Project-Maps
Second major project for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

************************************************
All code written by me was done in: abstractions.py, recommend.py, utils.py

Short Description of the project (Copied from the prompt)
-------------------------------------------------------------
![Pic](voronoi.png?raw=true)

In this project, you will create a visualization of restaurant ratings using machine learning and the Yelp academic dataset. In this visualization, Berkeley is segmented into regions, where each region is shaded by the predicted rating of the closest restaurant (yellow is 5 stars, blue is 1 star). Specifically, the visualization you will be constructing is a Voronoi diagram.

In the map above, each dot represents a restaurant. The color of the dot is determined by the restaurant's location. For example, downtown restaurants are colored green. The user that generated this map has a strong preference for Southside restaurants, and so the southern regions are colored yellow.

This project uses concepts from Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4.3 of Composing Programs. It also introduces techniques and concepts from machine learning, a growing field at the intersection of computer science and statistics that analyzes data to find patterns and make predictions.

The maps.zip archive contains all the starter code and data sets. The project uses several files, but all of your changes will be made to utils.py, abstractions.py, and recommend.py.

Short Description of each file:

>- abstractions.py: Data abstractions used in the project
>- recommend.py: Machine learning algorithms and data processing
>- utils.py: Utility functions for data processing
>- ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A
>- data: A directory of Yelp users, restaurants, and reviews
>- ok: The autograder
>- proj2.ok: The ok configuration file
>- tests: A directory of tests used by ok
>- users: A directory of user files
>- visualize: A directory of tools for drawing the final visualization 

**For more details on the project and its specification take a look at the prompt. I have included the webfiles for the Fall 2017 version of the project. Its in the folder titled "Project Prompt (Web Files)"**

##### PERSONAL NOTE #####

Disclaimer:  All projects in CS61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) at UC Berkeley were NOT done from scratch. Instead, students had to create core logic algorithms using the tools provided and learned. Furthermore, a testing program is provided alongside the project (called 'okpy') to ensure that the algorithms functions as desired. 

  
This project introduced the concept of data abstraction, in which we had to create and use our own data abstraction. It was a precursor to learning and using the object system in Python. Furthermore, it exposed me to the methods of machine learning as well as working on a larger project. 
This project specifically emphasized the use of lists and dictionaries while working with abstract data types. 

*Note: All of the code that I wrote for this program is surrounded by a comment marking the start and end.*
