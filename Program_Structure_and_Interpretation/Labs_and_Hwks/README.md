Miscellaneous Labs and Homework code

This displays my knowledge of 3 programming languages, thus 3 programming paradigms: Python (mostly Object Oriented Programming), Scheme (Functional Programming), and SQL (Declarative Programming). 


##### Personal Note #####
All homeworks and lab assignments were done via a prompt provided on the course website(https://cs61a.org/).
However, I have provided the web files for the Fall 2017 Homeworks and Lab assignment prompts.
Furthermore, all assignments were accompanied by a program checker (okpy).

Both homework assignments and lab assignments show my approach on interesting question, specifically the more challenging question (generally at the end of the assignment or as extra).
