5) **Labs_and_Hwks**
> This is a folder with all of my labs and homeworks. Most homeworks were problems that could be solved with little code, but emphesized certain ideas. Some of the last question of the homeworks and labs are very similar to common intervew questions. Labs were more similar to mini versions of a project.
