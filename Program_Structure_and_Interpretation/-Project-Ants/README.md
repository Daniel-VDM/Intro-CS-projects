# -Project-Ants
Third major project for Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

************************************************
All code written by me was done in: ants.py
************************************************

Short Description of the project (Copied from the prompt)
-------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, you will create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies.

This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, focusing on the material from Chapter 2.5 of Composing Programs. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

The ants.zip archive contains several files, but all of your changes will be made to ants.py.

Short Description of each file:

>- ants.py: The game logic of Ants Vs. SomeBees
>- ants_gui.py: The original GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
>- gui.py: An new GUI for Ants Vs. SomeBees
>- graphics.py: Utilities for displaying simple two-dimensional animations
>- state.py: Abstraction for gamestate for gui.py
>- utils.py: Some functions to facilitate the game interface
>- ucb.py: Utility functions for CS 61A
>- assets: A directory of images and files used by gui.py
>- img: A directory of images used by ants_gui.py
>- ok: The autograder
>- proj3.ok: The ok configuration file
>- tests: A directory of tests used by ok
>- mytests.rst: A space for you to add your custom tests; see section on adding your own tests

**For more details on the project and its specification take a look at the prompt. I have included the webfiles for the Fall 2017 version of the project. Its in the folder titled "Project Prompt (Web Files)"**

##### PERSONAL NOTE #####

Disclaimer:  All projects in CS61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs) at UC Berkeley were NOT done from scratch. Instead, students had to create core logic algorithms using the tools provided and learned. Furthermore, a testing program is provided alongside the project (called 'okpy') to ensure that the algorithms functions as desired. 
  
This project built on the idea of data abstraction and untalized the object system in Python instead of abstract data types. 

I was able to do the extra portion for this project which was to implement an ant that was able to inflict a 'status effect' for any bee that was hit by said ant. Furthermore, I had to implement the status effect logic. The status effect logic was quite challenging as we had to implement a stacking effect that had unique characteristics. Take a look at the prompt for more information on the requirement of the stacking effect. Doing the extra credit demonstrates my ability to understand OOP and 'reuse' code and implementations to create something new.

*Note: All of the code that I wrote for this program is surrounded by a comment marking the start and end*
