Data_Structure
----------------
> Prior to transferring to UC Berkeley I took a Data Structure course that covered the basics. Once I attended UC Berkeley I took a matriculation course to satisfy my Data Structures requirement. This folder contains all the projects done in that class as well as all notable projects that were done at IVC. All programs were written in Java.
>
>*There are 9 project. However, some projects of note are: __Blocks__, __Heap__, __MST__, and __BORG_Language__. (BORG program can be found in the IVC folder)*
>
>- The Blocks project is a large program that I wrote from scratch which incorporated multiple data structures and efficient algorithms to solve sliding-block puzzles in a timely manner. 
>- The Heap project is my implementation of a node based Heap that has the same time complexity as an array based Heap.
>- The MST project is my approach to storing a graph and finding the minimum spanning tree of said graph. 
>- The BORG_Language project is an interpreter for my own made up language called BORG.  


Program_Structure_and_Interpretation:
----------------
> This folder has all of my projects, homeworks and labs done in CS61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs). Throughout the course I learned and became proficient in Python, Scheme and SQL. 
>
>*There are 4 projects. However two projects of note are the __Scheme project__ and __Ants project__.*
>
>- The Scheme project demonstrates my knowledge of building the core logic of an interpreter as well as my knowledge of the Scheme language. 
>- Ants project demonstrates my knowledge of programming on a large scale project using object oriented programming.
