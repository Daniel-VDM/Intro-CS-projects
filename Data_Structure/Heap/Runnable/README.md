# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the Heap.jar file via the terminal. There are two arguments: Large and Small. "Large" argument fills and empties heaps up to size 51200, the "Small" argument fills and empties a heap of 12 elements.

Reference the project prompt for full specification of the program.

**An example would be something like this: `java -jar Heap.jar Large` executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**

-----------------------

**Also included is the jar file for a Debug mode that displays the Heap for the Node version of the Heap. I recommend only running it on the Small argument so: `java -jar HeapDebug.jar Small`**
