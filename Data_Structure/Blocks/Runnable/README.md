# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the Solver.class file via the terminal.

Refer to the project prompt for full specification of the program.

**An example would be something like this: "java Solver c52 50.52.goal" executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**

**An example of verifiying that the progarm works as desired is by piping my program through a checker with the following command: "java Solver c52 50.52.goal | java Checker c52 50.52.goal"**

*Note that the Checker class was provided by the course.*
