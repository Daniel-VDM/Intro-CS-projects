  <h1>Design Project: Blocks Project</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>This project has a number of interesting features. The problem to be
    solved is relatively complex. A solution will involve several time/space
    tradeoffs, and a solution program will be relatively large compared to
    other programs you have written for CS&nbsp;47B. It also provides an
    opportunity to store something other than strings in a hash table.</p>

<h2 class="Heading3">

</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1026526"> </a>Do the assignment described below. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1033280"> </a>For this assignment, you will work with a <span style="color: #000000;  font-style: italic; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; text-transform: none; vertical-align: baseline">sponsoring</span> tutor. He or she will act as a sounding board for ideas you have for solving the assignment and will supervise your completion of the necessary programs and writeups. Your sponsor will also be the tutor who grades your solutions; you should make sure that your schedule is compatible with his or hers, <i>as you must have each solution checked by your sponsor before continuing on to the next part.</i> You must arrange for a sponsor before starting work on the assignment.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1033633"> </a>A numeric grade between 0 and 24 rather than a "pass" or "not pass" will be assigned to your solution. Satisfaction of checklist items accounts for 20 of the 24 points; the other 4 points will be assigned by your sponsor for things like displaying sufficient progress at pre-arranged intermediate points. Make sure when you choose a sponsor tutor that he or she makes clear what you need to do to earn these 4 points.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1034187"> </a>You should get your grade for parts 1 and 2 recorded at the Self-Paced Center as soon as possible after you complete those parts.

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035271"> </a>The last part of this assignment includes a writeup.
  Prepare the writeup in a file named <tt>writeup</tt>, in one of the following formats:

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1027261"> </a>This project is to write a program that generates a solution to such a puzzle. The first part is a design, the second an implementation of the design, and the third is an optimization and writeup.

<h2 class="Heading3">
  <a name="1034813"> </a>Program interface
</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1034814"> </a>Your program will be named <tt>Solver.java</tt>. Its input will come from the command line and from files named there:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>
An optional first argument will be a string whose first two characters are "-o" and whose remaining characters specify information about what debugging output the program should produce. 
	(You may choose the format of this information.) The string "-ooptions" should cause the program to print all the debugging options and the effect of each option. 
	If the "-o" argument is not provided, your program should produce no output beyond that required to display a solution to the puzzle.
</p>
</li>
	<li><p>
The next argument will name a file that specifies an initial tray configuration. 
	Line 1 of this file will contain two positive integers, the length (number of rows) and width (number of columns) of the tray. 
	Each subsequent line of this file will contain four nonnegative integers describing a block in the tray: 
	the length and width of the block (both greater than 0), and the row and column of the upper left corner of the block. 
	(The upper left corner of the tray is row 0, column 0.) Blocks are indistinguishable except for their size, and may appear in any order in this file. 
	Thus the block configuration in figure 1 (reprinted below with row and column headers, and with blocks numbered to indicate their position in the example input) 
	might be represented in the file as follows:

	</li>
<li><p>The last argument will be the name of a file that specifies a desired final or goal configuration. 
This file is similar in format to the initial configuration file. 
Each line of this file contains four nonnegative integers: the length and width of the block (both greater than 0), and the desired position of the upper left corner of the block. 
This file will not necessarily contain entries for all blocks in the tray. Blocks may appear in any order in this file.</p>

<p>If there were more than one 2-by-2 block in the initial configuration, the one-line goal would specify the position of

Again, if there are more than three 1-by-1 blocks in the initial configuration, it doesn't matter which three of them end up in the specified goal positions.

  Blocks may only be moved an integer number of spaces, and either the row or the column will be the same in the start position as in the end position for each move. 
  (It's not legal to rotate the tray of blocks.)

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1034970"> </a>Your program should produce a line of output for each block move that leads directly to a solution.

</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035022"> </a>The <tt>Solver.Solver</tt> program will need to search the tree of possible move sequences to find a solution to the puzzle. In your design, outline in detail how the program will do the following:

	<li>generate moves possible in the current configuration, and choose the move to explore next;</li>

</ul>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035065"> </a>You should also associate debugging output with program events appropriately, and choose an appropriate debugging option for each set of output. Your debugging output facility should allow the user to select both the classes for which output is produced and the level of detail of output. Any interesting event that happens in your program-e.g. making/unmaking a move, encountering a previously seen configuration, determining the set of possible moves, or comparing a configuration with the goal-should be displayed by debugging output activated by some option. You should also incorporate output that will help you make implementation decisions about time/memory tradeoffs. Describe your debugging output facility in your writeup (see below). Your sponsor will ask you to defend your matching of output options with debugging output.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035119"> </a>You are to include an "is OK" method in your class that represents the tray. When an appropriate debugging option is enabled, a call to this method should accompany each change to objects in the class. The "is OK" method should throw <tt>IllegalStateException</tt> with an informative message if it finds a problem, e.g. two blocks occupying the same space in the tray, or a block sitting outside the tray.
</p>
<h2 class="Heading4">
  <a name="1035086"> </a>Program style and organization
</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035137"> </a>It is likely in this assignment that you will need to revise code you implement in this version to be able to handle larger puzzles. Thus you should organize your program into classes that allow easy substitution of efficient code for inefficient code or of one algorithm for another (e.g. depth-first move processing for breadth-first) in each area.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035087"> </a>As usual, your code should include informative comments for all your classes and methods. Use straightforward algorithms where possible. Give your variables and methods informative names. Declare all the data fields and methods within each class to have the proper <tt>public/private/protected/package</tt> qualifier. In particular, you are not allowed to make things public that would allow a user to corrupt your data structures (even if none of your own code would do this).
</p>
<h2 class="Heading4">
  <a name="1035068"> </a>Testing
</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035069"> </a>A compiled <tt>Checker</tt> program is available in the <tt>~cs47b/lib/puzzles</tt> directories (e.g. <tt>easy</tt>) to verify the output of your <tt>Solver.Solver</tt> program. To use it, copy any of the files <tt>Checker.class</tt> and <tt>TrayVerifier.class</tt> from the <tt>~cs47b/lib</tt> directory to your own directory: </p><pre class="Preformatted">    cp ~cs47b/lib/Checker.class .           # Note the trailing, standalone '.'
    cp ~cs47b/lib/TrayVerifier.class .
</pre>
Then, on a UNIX system, you may run the checker with a command like:
<pre>    java Solver.Solver <span style="font-style: italic;">init goal</span> | java Checker <span style="font-style: italic;">init goal</span>
</pre>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035071"> </a>(<span style="font-style: italic;">init</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">goal</span> stand for names of files containing the initial and goal configurations, respectively.)
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035072"> </a>Each of your classes must contain a <tt>main</tt> method that <u>thoroughly</u> tests the public and private methods of the class. Bring tests of individual classes with you to the Self-Paced Center for your sponsor to inspect. Also, the directory <tt>~cs47b/lib/puzzles/easy</tt> contains a number of puzzle files that your program must solve correctly: 
  </p><pre>  ls ~cs47b/lib/puzzles/easy
  </pre>
  Run your program on all of these puzzles - a file named <tt>README</tt> describes them:
  <pre>  cat ~cs47b/lib/puzzles/easy/README 
  </pre>
   ...A shell script <tt>run.easy</tt> will test them all at once - bring this output with you when you have this part graded:
  <pre class="Preformatted">    cp ~cs47b/lib/puzzles/easy/run.easy .           # Note the trailing, standalone '.'
    chmod +x run.easy
    
    script
    ./run.easy
    exit                             # The output will be a file named "typescript"
    </pre>
<p></p>
<h2 class="Heading4">
  <a name="1035107"> </a>Plan for part 3
</h2>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035108"> </a>Producing a program that can solve large or complicated puzzles involves answering a number of questions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Move generation will involve examining either the blocks in the tray or the empty space in the tray. Should the tray be stored as a list of blocks/empty spaces to optimize move generation, or should the locations in the tray be represented explicitly with a two-dimensional array? If the former, should blocks/spaces in the list be sorted?<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What board representation optimizes the operation of checking whether the goal has been reached? If this representation is incompatible with implementations that optimize move generation, how should the conflict be resolved?<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Should block moves of more than one space be considered? Why or why not?<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Should the tree of possible move sequences be processed depth first, breadth first, or some other way?<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The program needs to make and unmake moves. Again, a representation that optimizes these operations may not be so good for others. Determine how to evaluate tradeoffs among representations.<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The program must detect configurations that have previously been seen in order to avoid infinite loops. Hashing is a good technique to apply here. What's a good hash function for configurations? The default limits for Java memory allocation may limit the maximum number of configurations that the table can contain. (The blocks in the puzzle diagrammed in Figure 1 may be moved into 65,880 different configurations.) How can this constraint be accommodated, and what effect does it have on other operations?<br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035115"> </a>Some of these questions can be answered with careful analysis. Others require empirical evidence. Your program (with appropriate debugging options enabled) should produce enough information for you to make intelligent decisions about where its processing bottlenecks are. 
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035116"> </a>Your sponsor will expect you to identify and defend, in your plan for part 3, at least three avenues for program improvement, along with design decisions that you feel you made correctly in the current version.
</p>
<p class="Body">
  <a name="1035179"> </a>Again, once you get your program graded and an optimization plan approved, inform the Course Manager to get this approval recorded. If you spend too much time trying to make the program for this part efficient, you will lose pacing points and risk lowering your course grade.
