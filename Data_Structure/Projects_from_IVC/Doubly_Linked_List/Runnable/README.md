# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the Program2FromFile.jar file via the terminal.

For simplicity sake I hardcoded the file name for the data stored in the linked list.

**An example would be something like this: "java -jar Program2FromFile.jar" executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**
