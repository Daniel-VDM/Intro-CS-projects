# Doubly Linked List Program
This was the second project for Data Structures taken at Irvine Valley College (Spring 2017)

************************************************
The entire program was written by me.

Short Description of the project 
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is a simple implementation of a custom linked list that maintained two orders. So, essentially each node had two next pointers depending on which order was needed. The data used for this program were people and their weight. One order was the alphabetical order of people's name and the other order was their weight.
