# Data Structure Projects From Irvine Valley College

All projects done in Spring 2017 (Before attending IVC)
-------------

*These projects were relatively easier than the projects that I did at UC Berkeley. However, they do show different applications of Data Structures. **I think the BORG project stands out the most out of these projects as it was done from scratch and at the time I found it to be quite challenging.** These projects DO NOT come with prompts, instead I just included a short description of the program and my approach*

##### SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EACH PROJECT  #####
*Each project was fully written by me*

1) **BORG_Language**
>- This program is an interpreter for my own language, nicknamed BORG. The language is simple and only supports basic operations (more details in the project folder).

2) **BST_Usage**
>- This program is a basic implementation of a Binary Search Tree where a user can look up the contents of the BST. 

3) **Doubly_Linked_List**
>- This program is a basic implementation of a Linked List sorted in two different orders.

4) **RPN_Calculator**
>- A Basic Calculator for Reverse Polish Notation, or Postfix notation. '(ex 1 2 + = 3)'
