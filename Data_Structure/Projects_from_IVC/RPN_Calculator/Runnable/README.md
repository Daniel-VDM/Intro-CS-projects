# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the RPN-Calc.jar file via the terminal.

*Note that the program doesn't have an escape. Ctrl+Z can be used to throw and error so that the program exits*

**An example would be something like this: "java -jar RPN-Calc.jar" executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**
