# BORG Interpreter Program
This was the last project for Data Structures taken at Irvine Valley College (Spring 2017)

************************************************
The entire program was written by me.

Short Description of the project 
-------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of the project was to create an interpreter for my own made up language, nicknamed BORG. BORG had to support basic features that include: variable assignment, global / local scoping, comments, unary and binary operator (++, --, + ,- , \*, /, %, ^), and error catching. 

Variables and their scope was stored in a custom Hashtable (written by hand instead of using the java Hashtable)

*Note: this program was created before I attended UC Berkeley so it's probably not done in an efficient or robust manner; since I was not experienced with software design*

##### IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE PROGRAM #####

**I included a folder (Titled "Runnable") with all the information and files needed to run it. *Please read the readme.***
