# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the BORG_Main.jar file via the terminal.

Some test code written in BORG is provided. They are the Program.txt and ProgramTest.txt files. 

**An example would be something like this: `java -jar BORG_Main.jar` executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**
