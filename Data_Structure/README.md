# Data Structure Projects From UC Berkeley

All projects were done in Fall 2017
-------------

*These projects were part of UC Berkeley's CS47B course, a matriculation course for Data Structures. It was a self paced course that focused on the projects portion of UC Berkeley's Data Structures course.*

************************************************

##### SHORT DESCRIPTION OF EACH PROJECT  #####

*More details of each project can be found in the README.md of each folder*

1) **AmoebaFamily**
> This program focused on Java Iterator Class. It creates an amoeba family tree and iterates through the tree using BFS and DFS via an iterator. 

2) **Blocks**
> This was the major project for CS47B. This program solves sliding-blocks puzzles of size up to 256 X 256. The program had to be efficient as it had to solve puzzles under 2 minutes (on a school computer). 

3) **Hashing**
> This project was mostly an algorithm analysis project to see the efficiency of different hashing algorithms. Furthermore, I had to implement hashsets to make certain programs work.

4) **Heap**
> This program implements a aode (parent and child pointer) version of a Heap that had the same time complexity as an array based Heap.

5) **MST**
> This program is able to take graphs and find their Minimum Spanning Trees.

6) **Projects_from_IVC**
> All projects contained in this folder was done before I attended UC Berkeley. It includes all notable projected that I did in Data Structures at Irvine Valley College.
