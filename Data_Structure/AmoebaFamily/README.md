# -Project-Amoeba Family (Iterators)
This was the first (small-scale) project for Data Structures (CS47B)

************************************************
Most of the main program logic was written by me, however I was provided with a skeleton of the program.

Short Description of the project (Copied from the prompt)
-------------------------------------------------------------
**Goal**
>These exercises familiarize you with the design and use of an iterator, a class used to process all the elements in a collection one by one.

**Background**
>An amoeba family tree is simpler than a normal family tree because amoebas do not get married. An amoeba has one parent, perhaps a million siblings (brothers and sisters), and billions and billions of children. An amoeba also has a name.
The file AmoebaFamily.java contains most of the code to represent an amoeba family. Its main method sets up the following tree:
*You supply code to allow the amoebas in the family to be processed.*

##### PERSONAL NOTE #####
  
This was the first project of the semester so it covered the basics of iterators. The goal of the project was to implement a Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithm as well as mastering iterators in Java. I included a lot of comments while doing the program that show my thought process while completing the assignment.

##### IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE PROGRAM #####

**I included a folder (Titled "Runnable") with all the files needed to run it. *Please read the readme.***
