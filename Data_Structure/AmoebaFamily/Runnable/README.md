# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the AmoebaFamily.jar file via the terminal.

Reference the project prompt for full specification of the program.

**An example would be something like this: "java -jar AmoebaFamily.jar" executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**
