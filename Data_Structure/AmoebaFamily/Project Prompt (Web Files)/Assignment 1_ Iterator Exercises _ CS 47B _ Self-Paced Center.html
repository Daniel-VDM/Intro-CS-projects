  <h1>Assignment 1: Iterator Exercises</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>These exercises familiarize you with the design and use of an
    <dfn>iterator</dfn>, a class used to process all the elements in a
    collection one by one.</p>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>An amoeba family tree is simpler than a normal family tree because
    amoebas do not get married. An amoeba has one parent, perhaps a million
    siblings (brothers and sisters), and billions and billions of children. An
    amoeba also has a name.</p>

    <p>The file <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/doc/47b/AmoebaFamily.java"><code>AmoebaFamily.java</code></a> contains most of the code to represent an amoeba family. Its <code>main</code> method sets up the following tree:</p>

    <p>You supply code to allow the amoebas in the family to be processed.</p>

    <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
    <p>Provide the body for the <code>AmoebaFamily.addChild</code>
    method. Given a name of the parent amoeba and the name of a new child,
    <code>addChild</code> should return having added a new amoeba as the
    youngest child of the named parent amoeba. Do not change any of the
    framework code; you may, however, supply additional methods. Also, do not
    use the <code>ArrayList.get</code> method; instead, use the
    <code>ArrayList.iterator()</code> method to iterate over each amoeba's
    children.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Exercise 2</h2>

    <p>Provide the body for the <code>AmoebaFamily.print()</code> method. It
    should print the names of all amoebas in the family in <em>preorder</em>,
    with children's names printed oldest first. Output for the family set up in
    the <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code> method should be</p>

    <pre>Amos McCoy
mom/dad
me
Mike
Bart
Lisa
Homer
Marge
Bill
Hilary
Fred
Wilma</pre>

    <p>The <code>print</code> method or one of the methods it calls should be
    recursive. It should print the names of an amoeba family of <code>N</code>
    amoebas in <code>O(N)</code> operations (counting each call to
    <code>Amoeba.toString()</code> as a single operation). Do not change any of
    the framework code; you may, however, supply additional methods.</p>

    <p>Test your code for Exercises 1 and 2 using the
    <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code> method.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Exercise 3</h2>

    <p>Complete the <code>AmoebaIterator</code> class. It should successively
    return amoebas from the family in preorder, with children amoebas returned
    oldest first. Thus, for the family set up in the
    <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code> method, the amoeba named "Amos McCoy" should
    be returned by the first call to <code>next()</code>; the second call to
    <code>next()</code> should return the amoeba named "mom/dad"; and so on. Do
    not change any of the framework code.</p>

    <p>Iteration over all of the amoebas in a family of <code>N</code> amoebas
    should require no more than <code>O(N)</code> operations. Also, the
    iterator constructor should run in constant time (thus, a solution that
    puts all the amoebas into a linear structure, then returns them one by one
    is not allowed). Your implementation will require the use of a
    <code>Stack</code>.</p>

    <p>Uncomment the code at the end of the <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code>
    method to test your solution. It should produce the same output as the call
    to <code>family.print()</code>.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Exercise 4</h2>

    <p>Rewrite the <code>AmoebaIterator</code> class so that amoebas are
    returned <em>breadth first</em>. That is, the root of the family should be
    returned first, then all of its children (oldest first), then all of their
    children, and so on. For the family constructed in the
    <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code> method, the amoebas should be returned in
    the following sequence:</p>

    <pre>Amos McCoy
mom/dad
me
Fred
Wilma
Mike
Homer
Marge
Bart
Lisa
Bill
Hilary</pre>

    <p>As in Exercise 3, enumeration of all the amoebas in a family of
    <code>N</code> amoebas should require no more than <code>O(N)</code>
    operations, and the constructor must run in constant time. Your
    implementation will require the use of a <code>Queue</code> where the
    Exercise 3 solution used a <code>Stack</code>.</p>

    <p>Test your code with the <code>AmoebaFamily.main</code> method from
    Exercise 3.</p>

    <h2>Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Correctly working additions to the framework, implemented without changing any of the framework code:
        <ul>
          <li>an <code>addChild</code> method that uses <code>ArrayList.iterator()</code> to examine amoeba children;</li>
          <li>an efficient <code>print()</code> method that prints amoeba names in the specified order;</li>
          <li>one version of the <code>AmoebaIterator</code> class in which the <code>next()</code> method efficiently returns amoebas in preorder, with children returned oldest first;</li>
          <li>another version of the <code>AmoebaIterator</code> class in which the <code>next()</code> method efficiently returns amoebas breadth first;</li>
          <li>constructors for these iterators that run in constant time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Program listings, with methods indented to show their structure, accompanied by comments that describe their purpose and arguments.</li>
      <li>Reasonable names for variables, methods, and parameters.</li>
