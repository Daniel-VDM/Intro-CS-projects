# READ THIS PLEASE

If you want to run my code for yourself, execute the the MST.jar file via the terminal.

Reference the project prompt for full specification of the program.

**An example would be something like this: "java -jar MST.jar" executed when in a directory with all of the contents of this folder**

*Note: You can add your own graph to the data.txt and it will find the MST.*

#### How to input your own graph ####
> Each line is an edge with the following key: **start_vertex end_vertex weight**. So **1 2 3** would be an edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2 with a weight of 3
