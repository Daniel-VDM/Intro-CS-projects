# -Project-Minimum Spanning Tree Project (MST)
This was fourth project for Data Structures (CS47B)

************************************************
The entire program was written by me.
************************************************

Short Description of the project (Copied from the prompt)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Implement Prim's algorithm. Your implementation should run in time O(e log n), where n is the number of vertices and e the number of edges in the graph. Be prepared to verify its running time for a tutor, with a defense of your choices for the graph representation and auxiliary data structures. Provide six tests using the graph just described, each with a different choice of starting vertex.

**For more details on the project and its specification take a look at the prompt *(http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/47b/p4/minimum-spanning-tree/)*. Just incase it has been changed, I have included the webfiles for the Fall 2017 version of the project. Its in the folder titled "Project Prompt (Web Files)"**

##### PERSONAL NOTE #####
  
This program demonstrates my knowledge of representing graphs in a program aswell as finding the MST of said graph. It also shows my implementation of Prim's algorithm.

I documented my program as I wrote it so the comments show my thought process for each part of the program. 

The GraphSorter object was designed for expansion, that is, I could add different types of MST algorithms easily, like Dijkstra's MST algorithm, so that the object can yield different MSTs at the same time.

##### IF YOU WANT TO RUN THE PROGRAM #####

**I included a folder (Titled "Runnable") with all the information and files needed to run it. *Please read the readme.***
