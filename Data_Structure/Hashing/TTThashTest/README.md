# -Project-HashTest
This was part 2 of project 2 for Data Structures (CS47B)

************************************************
Only a small portion of the code was written by me. (I noted all the parts that i added as comments)

Short Description of the project (Copied from the prompt)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The code in TTThashTest.java stores all possible Tic-tac-toe boards into a java.util.Hashtable object. Add methods to the TTTboard class in TTTboard.java that test two ways to hash Tic-tac-toe boards. In one, you should convert the board to a String and then use the String hashCode function. In the other, you should interpret the Tic-tac-toe board as a nine-digit base 3 numeral and return the corresponding integer as the hash value. Compare the performance of these two implementations.

In many Java environments, String methods are "native", that is, they are supplied in the machine language of the computer on which the program is executing. The data you collect in this exercise should indicate whether or not this is the case on the computer you're using.
