# -Project-HashTest
This was a 3 part project for Data Structures (CS47B)

************************************************
Overall there wasn't much programming involved for this project, instead there was a lot of analysis. For full detail on the prompt for this project, reference: http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/47b/p2/hashing-exercises/. Just incase, I have included the webfiles for the Fall 2017 version of the prompt in the file titled "Project Prompt (Web Files)".
