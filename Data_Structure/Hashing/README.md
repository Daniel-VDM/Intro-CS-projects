************************************************
Overall there wasn't much programming involved for this project, instead there was a lot of analysis.

**For more details on the project and its specification take a look at the prompt *(http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~selfpace/47b/p2/hashing-exercises/)*. Just incase it has been changed, I have included the webfiles for the Fall 2017 version of the project. Its in the folder titled "Project Prompt (Web Files)"**
